## Background and Theme

The development period is from January 25 to January 27, 2019.

There are five members of the development team, one program, two artists, one planner, and one sound effect. I am in charge of the program

The theme of this game development is: HOME.

## 设计思路

This work adopts a design that the difficulty increases as the player makes mistakes.

There are three small light balls that revolve around the large light ball representing the player. The three light balls both represent health and have a gameplay function at the same time - providing vision, the more the small light balls are, the more players can see Obstacles in a wider range. When the player's body touches various obstacles that represent difficulties in different stages of life, if there are still small light balls beside him at this time, the number of small light balls will be -1, and the range of light vision will be reduced.

The reason for choosing this theme is mainly because everyone feels that the main body of HOME is family, and family plays a role in helping us overcome difficulties and leading us to see the way forward in our life journey. This is also the origin of the work's name "Tu".

The shortcoming of the game is that I chose to randomly calculate the coordinates of the obstacles according to the formula out of consideration of the construction period and unfamiliarity with the map settings, which made the game difficult or not as interesting as the operability. In addition, the original design mechanism that the small light ball will slowly disappear even if it does not touch the obstacle has been deleted due to the difficulty of the game.
